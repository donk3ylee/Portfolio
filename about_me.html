            <h2>Childhood</h2>
            <p>When I was 8 or 9 years old my father brought me an Acorn Electron a few games and a book to learn the BASIC programming language. While I enjoyed games, &lbbrk;as any child would!&rbbrk; I also wanted to know how they worked so I would look at the source code of games and used the book to teach myself the BASIC programming language. I even wrote a few games myself.</p>
            <p>Sadly after 3 years of heavy use my beloved Acorn Electron developed a power circuit problem which nobody could fix and as computers back then were very expensive, this effectively ended me learning any more programming. While this did temporarily put an end to my learning path, it did make me realise that I could teach myself anything through trial and error using a simple text as a starting point, giving me an enormous amount of self confidence in my ability to learn.</p>
            <h2>1990's</h2>
            <p>In my early adulthood I became involved in motorcycle racing wanting to get closer to the action but not having the funds to race I became a track marshal. Marshals work in small teams on the corners of racetracks and work to keep racing safe by using flags to communicate with riders, accident recovery and working with medics. My work as a marshal eventually led to working for a couple of race teams as a data acquisition engineer. Data engineers use the data collected by onboard sensors and work with the rider and the race engineer in order to improve lap times and consistency.</p>
            <h2>2000's Until Today</h2>
            <p>In the early 2000’s I really started to see how important the internet was becoming. Emboldened by my experience of teaching myself BASIC I began teaching myself front end web development such as HTML and the early versions of CSS. Eventually this led on to backend technologies such as PHP and MySQL within a “open source” LAMP environment. I did take on some freelancing work but I never felt confident enough to make this my full-time career and sadly life took over and I never continued to learn.</p>
            <p>When the pandemic hit, I was working in hotel management. I continued working through the lockdown period, looking after the building at night, but when the hotel eventually reopened it forced me to leave. I rode out the second lock-down period during which I found out about the Netmatters SCS Scion course. The Scion course seemed perfect for me. I could now retrain and pursue a career in an industry which I wanted to be in.</p>
            <h2>The Netmatters SCS Scion Course</h2>
            <p>The course run by the Netmatters Digital Agency is an intensive remote learning web development course which upon completion gives you enough skills to enter the role of a junior web developer. It has been sometime since I last studied web development and as you can imagine many technologies have moved on significantly. I am now fully committed and on my way to a career as a back-end web developer and this course is the perfect vehicle to get me there. I can build upon my knowledge and I have the confidence to self-learn which is a major part of this course.</p>
            <h2>Physical computing and the IOT</h2>
            <p>For some time now I have enjoyed playing around with Arduino microcontrollers and single computer boards such as the raspberry PI. Microcontrollers are inexpensive computer chips that take physical inputs, you then write programming code that controls output devices connected to the microcontroller. When connected to the internet this type of real world programming can become very interesting.</p>
            <p>That's pretty much all about me. If your interested in finding out more about my current skill-set, or want to discuss any open positions which you feel may suit me, please don't hesitate to
